# Dynamic Multi-Frequency Analysis (DMFA)
This is a collection of *Matlab* scripts to perform DMFA.

## Instruction ##
Copy or clone this repository and add the folder location to your Matlab path or simply work inside this folder.
To see how it works in RawData there are some raw data to analyze. To import the raw data launch _importData_ and then launch _Z_DMFA_ to make the analysis.
At the end of the analysis it will be asked if you want to save.
Launch _PlotDMFA_ to see the results.
